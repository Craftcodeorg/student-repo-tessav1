Create an interactive coding platform that simulates real-world technical interviews, specifically tailored for candidates applying to top tech companies. The platform should include:
- A collection of DSA problems relevant to coding interviews, with varying difficulty levels.
- Mock interview sessions that simulate real-time coding challenges, including behavioral questions.
- Integration of player statistics from Chelsea F.C. games to create algorithmic challenges related to sports analytics, such as predicting match outcomes based on player performance data.
The project should demonstrate proficiency in data structures, algorithms, and Python optimization techniques while providing an engaging user experience.
