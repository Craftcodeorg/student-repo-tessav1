# Module Title: Technical Interview Preparation Strategies

## Exercise Requirements

### Problem Statement
As a candidate preparing for a technical interview in the field of Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics, you need to create a list of common behavioral questions that you might encounter during your interviews. For each question, prepare a thoughtful response that showcases your relevant experiences and skills. 

Reflect on your past work experiences, especially in team settings or under pressure, and consider how these experiences align with the skills and qualities sought by top tech companies.

### Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
Below is a starter code snippet related to calculating player performance metrics, which you can adapt to simulate a scenario similar to your technical interviews. Fill in the blanks to complete the function.

```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts
def calculate_player_performance(goals, assists):
    """
    Calculate the performance score of a player based on goals and assists.
    
    The performance score is calculated as:
    performance_score = (goals * 4) + (assists * 3)
    """
    # Calculate performance score
    performance_score = (____ * 4) + (____ * 3)
    return performance_score

# Test the function with example values from a Chelsea F.C. match
print(calculate_player_performance(____, ____))
```

### Hints
1. **Behavioral Questions**: Think about situations where you demonstrated leadership or teamwork. For example, "Describe a time when you had to work with a difficult team member."
   
2. **Technical Application**: Remember that the performance score can be influenced by both goals and assists. Make sure to fill in the blanks with the appropriate parameters from the function definition.

3. **Real-World Context**: Relate your answers to specific experiences in your past roles. Consider how you handled challenges in project deadlines or technical difficulties.

### Expected Outcome
By completing this exercise, you should be able to:
- List at least five common behavioral questions and articulate well-thought-out responses that highlight your skills and experiences.
- Fill in the blanks in the starter code correctly, demonstrating your understanding of performance metrics in a sports context.
- Showcase your ability to apply technical knowledge in a real-world scenario relevant to your field.

The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling where applicable, and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, reflecting the concepts discussed in the lecture.

## Integration
This exercise can be integrated into your learning platform as follows:
- Use markdown for formatting and clear headings.
- Ensure that all sections are easily navigable.
- Include links to additional resources on behavioral interview preparation and coding challenges tailored for technical interviews.

By completing this exercise, you will enhance your critical thinking skills while preparing effectively for your upcoming technical interviews.
