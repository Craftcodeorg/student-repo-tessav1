### Module Title: Technical Interview Preparation Strategies ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

#### 1. Problem Statement
Create a function that simulates a timed problem-solving session for a technical interview question related to data structures. The problem will involve calculating the average speed of a player in a soccer match based on the distance covered and the time taken. This exercise will help you apply the concepts discussed in the lecture, particularly in simulating mock interviews and practicing under time constraints.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts
def calculate_average_speed(distance, time):
    """
    Calculate the average speed of a player based on the distance covered
    and the time taken during a soccer match.
    
    Parameters:
    distance (float): The distance covered by the player in meters.
    time (float): The time taken by the player in seconds.
    
    Returns:
    float: The average speed in meters per second.
    """
    # Ensure time is not zero to avoid division by zero error
    if time == 0:
        raise ValueError("Time cannot be zero.")
    
    # Calculate average speed
    average_speed = _______ / _______
    
    return average_speed

# Test the function with example values
print(calculate_average_speed(1000, 90))  # Example: 1000 meters in 90 seconds
```

#### 3. Hints
- **Hint 1**: Remember that average speed is calculated by dividing the total distance by the total time taken.
- **Hint 2**: Make sure to handle cases where time might be zero to prevent errors in your calculations.
- **Hint 3**: Use descriptive variable names for clarity and maintainability, as emphasized in the lecture.

#### 4. Expected Outcome
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly with `distance` and `time`, demonstrating an understanding of how to apply mathematical concepts in programming. The final solution should include error handling for division by zero, be well-commented to explain each step, and follow best practices as discussed in the lecture. 

Upon completion, you should be able to:
- Simulate a realistic interview scenario.
- Articulate your thought process while solving the problem.
- Reflect on your performance and identify areas for improvement based on feedback from peers or mentors.

### Integration ###
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links. 

By completing this exercise, you will reinforce your understanding of mock interview techniques and best practices while applying them to a real-world scenario relevant to your interests in Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics.
