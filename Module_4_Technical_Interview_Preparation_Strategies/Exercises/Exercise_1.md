### Module Title: Technical Interview Preparation Strategies

### Exercise Requirements

#### 1. Problem Statement:
Conduct a mock interview with a peer focusing on DSA questions. In this exercise, you will simulate a technical interview scenario where you will be the interviewer and your peer will be the candidate. You will ask a series of DSA-related questions based on the formats discussed in the lecture, and provide feedback on their performance.

**Scenario**: You are interviewing a candidate for a software engineering position at a robotics company. The candidate must demonstrate their knowledge of data structures and algorithms, particularly in the context of optimizing algorithms for real-time data processing.

#### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code:
Below is a starter code snippet for analyzing player performance data related to Chelsea F.C. You need to complete the function to calculate the speed of a player based on distance covered and time taken during a match.

```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts
def calculate_speed(distance, time):
    # Calculate speed by dividing distance by time, as discussed in the lecture
    speed = _______ / _______
    return speed

# Test the function with example values from the lecture
print(calculate_speed(100, 10))  # Expected output: 10.0
```

#### 3. Hints:
- Remember that speed is defined as distance divided by time. 
- Ensure that you handle potential division by zero errors gracefully.
- Consider adding comments to your code to explain each step clearly.
- Think about how you would test your function with different inputs to validate its correctness.

#### 4. Expected Outcome:
Upon completion of this exercise, you should be able to:
- Fill in the blanks correctly to demonstrate an understanding of how to calculate speed.
- Implement error handling for cases where time is zero.
- Write well-commented code that explains the logic behind each step.
- Conduct a mock interview effectively by assessing your peerâ€™s problem-solving abilities and providing constructive feedback.

### Integration
- Ensure that all parts of this exercise are well-structured and clearly labeled for easy navigation.
- Use markdown formatting for clarity, and include any necessary links to resources or additional reading materials that may assist in preparation for technical interviews. 

By completing this exercise, you will enhance your practical application of the concepts learned in the lecture while also honing your interviewing skills, which are crucial for succeeding in technical coding interviews at top tech companies.
