### Assignment: Developing a Personal Study Plan Based on Mock Interview Feedback

#### Problem Statement:
As an aspiring software engineer in the Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics industry, you need to develop a personal study plan that leverages feedback from mock interviews. This plan will focus on mastering data structures and algorithms (DSA) and optimizing Python code. The goal is to simulate a realistic interview preparation environment that aligns with your career aspirations and technical expertise.

**Task:** Create a Python function that generates a personalized study plan based on the strengths and weaknesses identified during mock interviews. The study plan should include a schedule for practicing specific coding problems, reviewing key concepts, and conducting mock interviews.

#### Starter Code:
```python
# Starter code for generating a personalized study plan

def generate_study_plan(feedback):
    """
    Generate a personalized study plan based on feedback from mock interviews.
    
    Parameters:
    feedback (dict): A dictionary containing strengths and weaknesses identified in mock interviews.
    
    Returns:
    list: A list of study activities with a schedule.
    """
    
    study_plan = []
    
    # Step 1: Analyze feedback
    strengths = feedback.get('strengths', [])
    weaknesses = feedback.get('weaknesses', [])
    
    # Step 2: Create study activities based on strengths and weaknesses
    if 'DSA' in strengths:
        study_plan.append("Review advanced data structures (trees, graphs) for 2 hours.")
    if 'Python optimization' in weaknesses:
        study_plan.append("Practice Python optimization techniques for 1 hour.")
    
    # Step 3: Schedule mock interviews
    study_plan.append("Schedule 1 mock interview per week.")
    
    return study_plan

# Example feedback from mock interviews
feedback = {
    'strengths': ['DSA', 'problem-solving'],
    'weaknesses': ['Python optimization', 'timed coding challenges']
}

# Generate the study plan
personal_study_plan = generate_study_plan(feedback)
print("Personal Study Plan:")
for activity in personal_study_plan:
    print(f"- {activity}")
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Step 1: Analyze Feedback**
   - Modify the `generate_study_plan` function to accept feedback in the form of a dictionary containing two keys: `strengths` and `weaknesses`.
   - Ensure that the function can handle cases where either key might be missing.

2. **Step 2: Create Study Activities**
   - Expand the logic to create study activities based on various strengths and weaknesses. For example:
     - If the feedback indicates strengths in DSA, include activities that review advanced data structures.
     - If weaknesses are noted in timed coding challenges, add practice sessions focused on time management strategies.

3. **Step 3: Schedule Mock Interviews**
   - Include a suggestion for scheduling regular mock interviews. You can use a simple string to indicate how often these should occur (e.g., weekly).

4. **Step 4: Enhance Output**
   - Format the output to make it user-friendly. Consider adding headers or separators to distinguish between different types of activities (e.g., review sessions vs. mock interviews).

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Success Criteria:**
  - The function accurately generates a study plan based on the provided feedback.
  - The code is clean, well-documented, and follows best practices.
  - The output is formatted clearly and provides actionable steps for preparation.

- **Evaluation Rubric:**
  - **Accuracy (40%)**: The study plan reflects the strengths and weaknesses accurately.
  - **Code Quality (30%)**: Code is well-structured, readable, and adheres to Python coding standards.
  - **Output Clarity (30%)**: The generated study plan is easy to understand and actionable.

This assignment encourages you to apply key concepts from the lecture on mock interview techniques and best practices while focusing on real-world applications relevant to your field of interest.
