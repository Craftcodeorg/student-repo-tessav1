## Example 2: Solving a Coding Problem Under Time Constraints

### 1. Introduction
In technical interviews, particularly in fields like Robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics, candidates often face coding problems that must be solved under time constraints. This example emphasizes the importance of efficiently solving coding problems while demonstrating proficiency in algorithms and data structures. By mastering this skill, you can improve your chances of success in high-stakes interviews at top tech companies.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here is a Python code snippet that illustrates how to solve a problem under time constraints, specifically focusing on optimizing a function that processes sensor data in a robotics application. This example includes error handling and follows best practices for coding.

```python
def process_sensor_data(sensor_readings):
    """
    Processes a list of sensor readings to calculate the average and 
    identify any anomalies (readings that are significantly higher than average).
    
    Parameters:
        sensor_readings (list): A list of numerical sensor readings.
        
    Returns:
        tuple: A tuple containing the average reading and a list of anomalies.
    """
    if not sensor_readings:
        raise ValueError("Sensor readings list cannot be empty.")
    
    try:
        # Calculate the average reading
        average_reading = sum(sensor_readings) / len(sensor_readings)
        
        # Identify anomalies
        anomalies = [reading for reading in sensor_readings if reading > average_reading * 1.5]
        
        return average_reading, anomalies
    except TypeError as e:
        raise TypeError("All sensor readings must be numerical.") from e

# Example usage
sensor_data = [10, 12, 15, 20, 30, 25, 100]
average, anomalies = process_sensor_data(sensor_data)
print(f"Average sensor reading: {average}")
print(f"Anomalies detected: {anomalies}")
```

### 3. Explanation
This code defines a function `process_sensor_data` that takes a list of sensor readings as input. Here's a breakdown of how it implements the key concepts from the lecture:

- **Error Handling**: The function raises a `ValueError` if the input list is empty and handles `TypeError` to ensure that all readings are numerical. This is crucial in real-world applications where data integrity is vital.
  
- **Calculating Average**: The average of the sensor readings is calculated using `sum(sensor_readings) / len(sensor_readings)`. This demonstrates the application of basic algorithms in data processing.
  
- **Identifying Anomalies**: The function employs list comprehension to find readings that are significantly higher than the average (greater than 1.5 times the average). This is a common technique used in data analysis to filter out outliers.

This code snippet effectively demonstrates problem-solving under time constraints by providing a clear and efficient method for processing data while maintaining readability and error management.

### 4. Application
In the context of Robotics, this function could be used to analyze data from various sensors (e.g., temperature, pressure, or motion sensors) to monitor equipment performance or detect malfunctions. For instance, if a robotic arm's temperature sensor records an unusually high reading, the function can quickly identify this anomaly, prompting immediate investigation or corrective action.

In the semiconductor industry, similar algorithms are used to analyze test data from chips during production. By efficiently processing this data and identifying outliers, manufacturers can enhance quality control and reduce defects, ultimately improving product reliability.

### Conclusion
Understanding how to solve coding problems efficiently under time constraints is essential for succeeding in technical interviews. By practicing with real-world scenarios like processing sensor data, you can build confidence and proficiency in both coding and problem-solving skills, aligning with your career goals in the tech industry. 

### Next Steps
To further enhance your preparation, consider engaging in timed coding challenges that simulate real interview conditions. Focus on refining your ability to implement algorithms efficiently while adhering to best coding practices. Additionally, explore mock interview platforms that provide feedback on your performance to identify areas for improvement.
