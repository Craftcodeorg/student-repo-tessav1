### Quiz Questions ###

1. **QUESTION 1**: How does a binary tree differ from a linked list in terms of structure?
   - A) A binary tree has a fixed number of children (two), while a linked list has one child.
   - B) A binary tree is a linear structure, while a linked list is hierarchical.
   - C) A binary tree allows for multiple paths from the root to leaves, while a linked list has a single path.
   - D) A binary tree is always sorted, while a linked list is not necessarily sorted.
   - **Correct Answer**: C

2. **QUESTION 2**: What is a key advantage of using a linked list over a binary tree?
   - A) Linked lists can store data in a sorted manner.
   - B) Linked lists allow for efficient insertions and deletions at any point.
   - C) Linked lists require less memory than binary trees.
   - D) Linked lists can represent hierarchical data structures better than binary trees.
   - **Correct Answer**: B

3. **QUESTION 3**: Which statement accurately describes the access time for elements in a binary tree compared to a linked list?
   - A) Access time in a binary tree is always O(1), while in a linked list it is O(n).
   - B) Access time in both structures is O(n).
   - C) Access time in a binary tree can be O(log n), while in a linked list it is O(n).
   - D) Access time in a binary tree is faster than in a linked list for all operations.
   - **Correct Answer**: C
