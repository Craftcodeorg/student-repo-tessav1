# Module Title: Introduction to Data Structures

## Example 4: Queue Implementation Using Python

### 1. Introduction
In the context of the lecture on the importance of data structures in algorithm optimization, the concept of a queue is particularly significant. A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First In First Out (FIFO) principle, where the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed. This structure is essential in various applications within robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics, where managing tasks or data in a sequential manner is crucial.

In robotics, for instance, queues can be used to manage tasks that robots must perform in a specific order, such as processing sensor data or executing commands. In semiconductor manufacturing, queues help manage the flow of materials through production lines. In consumer electronics, they can manage user inputs or network requests efficiently.

### 2. Code Snippet
Here is a well-commented Python implementation of a queue using a class structure. This implementation includes error handling and best practices suitable for an intermediate-level programmer.

```python
class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []  # Initialize an empty list to store queue elements

    def is_empty(self):
        """Check if the queue is empty."""
        return len(self.items) == 0

    def enqueue(self, item):
        """Add an item to the back of the queue."""
        self.items.append(item)  # Append item to the end of the list

    def dequeue(self):
        """Remove and return the item from the front of the queue."""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Dequeue from an empty queue")  # Error handling for empty queue
        return self.items.pop(0)  # Remove and return the first item

    def peek(self):
        """Return the front item of the queue without removing it."""
        if self.is_empty():
            raise IndexError("Peek from an empty queue")  # Error handling for empty queue
        return self.items[0]  # Return the first item without removing it

    def size(self):
        """Return the number of items in the queue."""
        return len(self.items)

    def __str__(self):
        """Return a string representation of the queue."""
        return "Queue: " + str(self.items)  # Provide a readable format for debugging

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    q = Queue()
    q.enqueue("Task 1")
    q.enqueue("Task 2")
    print(q)  # Output: Queue: ['Task 1', 'Task 2']
    
    print(q.dequeue())  # Output: Task 1
    print(q.peek())     # Output: Task 2
    print(q.size())     # Output: 1
```

### 3. Explanation
- **Class Definition**: We define a `Queue` class that encapsulates all functionalities related to queue operations.
- **Initialization**: The constructor initializes an empty list to hold the queue items.
- **is_empty Method**: This method checks whether the queue has any elements, returning `True` if it's empty and `False` otherwise.
- **enqueue Method**: This method adds an element to the end of the queue using `append()`.
- **dequeue Method**: This method removes and returns the front element of the queue. It includes error handling to raise an exception if an attempt is made to dequeue from an empty queue.
- **peek Method**: Similar to dequeue, but it retrieves the front element without removing it, also with error handling.
- **size Method**: Returns the number of elements currently in the queue.
- **__str__ Method**: Provides a string representation for easy debugging.

### 4. Application
In robotics, consider a scenario where a robot must process tasks in a specific order, such as picking up items, moving them to a designated location, and then returning to pick up more items. Implementing a queue allows you to manage these tasks efficiently:

- Each task (e.g., "Pick Item A", "Move Item A", "Return to Base") can be enqueued as it is generated.
- The robot processes each task in order, ensuring that it completes tasks sequentially without missing any steps.
- This approach enhances efficiency and reliability in operations, particularly in complex environments where multiple tasks are generated simultaneously.

In semiconductor manufacturing, queues are critical for managing production steps where materials must be processed in a specific sequence. By utilizing queues, manufacturers can optimize workflow and reduce bottlenecks, leading to increased productivity and lower costs.
