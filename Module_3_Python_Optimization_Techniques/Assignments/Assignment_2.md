### Assignment Title: Performance Report on Data Manipulation Methods in Python

#### Problem Statement:
As a robotics engineer, you often need to analyze and manipulate large datasets efficiently. In this assignment, you will create a performance report comparing different methods of data manipulation in Python. Specifically, you will profile the performance of list comprehensions, `map()` functions, and traditional for-loops when processing a dataset of numerical values. This task will help you understand which method is the most efficient in terms of execution time and resource usage.

#### Starter Code:
```python
import cProfile
import random

# Generate a sample dataset of random integers
data = [random.randint(1, 1000) for _ in range(10000)]

def list_comprehension(data):
    """Process data using list comprehension."""
    return [x * 2 for x in data]

def map_function(data):
    """Process data using map() function."""
    return list(map(lambda x: x * 2, data))

def for_loop(data):
    """Process data using a traditional for-loop."""
    result = []
    for x in data:
        result.append(x * 2)
    return result

# Profile each method
def profile_data_manipulation():
    print("Profiling List Comprehension:")
    cProfile.run('list_comprehension(data)')
    
    print("\nProfiling Map Function:")
    cProfile.run('map_function(data)')
    
    print("\nProfiling For Loop:")
    cProfile.run('for_loop(data)')

# Call the profiling function
profile_data_manipulation()
```

#### Detailed Instructions:
1. **Setup the Environment**: Ensure you have Python installed on your machine and create a new Python file for this assignment.

2. **Understand the Starter Code**: Review the provided starter code. It includes three different methods for processing a list of integers. Each method multiplies each element by 2.

3. **Modify the Code**:
   - **Step 1**: Add functionality to record and compare the execution time of each method. You can enhance the `profile_data_manipulation()` function to store the results in a structured format (like a dictionary or a list).
   - **Step 2**: After profiling, format the output to clearly present the execution times for each method. You should display the average execution time and any notable observations about memory usage.
   - **Step 3**: Implement additional data manipulation methods (e.g., using NumPy or Pandas) and profile their performance as well. Update your report to include these new methods.

4. **Run the Code**: Execute your modified script to see the performance report generated by `cProfile`. 

5. **Analyze Results**: Reflect on which method performed best and why. Consider aspects like readability, speed, and memory efficiency.

#### Criteria for Success and Evaluation:
- **Correctness**: The code must correctly implement and profile each data manipulation method.
- **Performance Analysis**: The final output should clearly show execution times for each method, along with any observations on performance differences.
- **Code Quality**: The code should be well-organized, commented, and follow best practices for readability and efficiency.
- **Reflection**: Include a brief written reflection at the end of your report discussing which method you would recommend for data manipulation tasks in robotics and why.

This assignment not only reinforces the concepts learned in the lecture about profiling Python code but also provides practical experience that is directly applicable to your work in robotics, semiconductors, and consumer electronics.
