### Module Title: Python Optimization Techniques

### Exercise Requirements

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   Rewrite a function that processes player statistics for Chelsea F.C. using list comprehensions instead of traditional loops. The function should take a list of player scores and return a new list containing only the scores that are above a certain threshold, which represents high-performing players.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**: 
   Provide starter code with strategically placed blanks that the student must fill in to complete the functionality. The code should include comments and guidance relevant to Premier League Soccer (Chelsea F.C.) and be appropriate for someone with Intermediate experience.

```python
# Starter code for implementing lecture concepts
def filter_high_scores(scores, threshold):
    """
    Filters out scores that are below the threshold using list comprehensions.
    
    Parameters:
    scores (list): A list of player scores.
    threshold (int): The score threshold to filter high-performing players.

    Returns:
    list: A list of scores that are above the threshold.
    """
    # Use list comprehension to filter scores
    high_scores = [score for score in scores if score > _______]
    return high_scores

# Test the function with example values
player_scores = [10, 15, 8, 20, 5, 25]  # Example player scores
threshold_value = _____  # Set the threshold value for filtering
print(filter_high_scores(player_scores, threshold_value))
```

3. **Hints**: 
   - Think about how list comprehensions can simplify your code by combining the loop and conditional statement into one line.
   - Remember that the `if` statement inside the list comprehension should compare each score to the `threshold`.
   - Consider what value you want to use as a threshold to filter out high-performing players. You can choose a number based on your understanding of what constitutes a "high score."

4. **Expected Outcome**: 
   The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to apply list comprehensions to optimize their code. The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling (e.g., checking if the scores list is empty), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

### Integration
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
