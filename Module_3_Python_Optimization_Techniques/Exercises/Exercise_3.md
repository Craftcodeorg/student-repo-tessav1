# Module Title: Python Optimization Techniques

## Exercise Requirements

### 1. Problem Statement
You are tasked with analyzing the performance of a Python script that processes player statistics for Chelsea F.C. The script currently uses a loop to calculate the total goals scored by all players over multiple matches. Your goal is to analyze the memory usage of this script and suggest optimizations using built-in functions and libraries discussed in the lecture.

### 2. Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code
```python
import pandas as pd

# Sample data representing player statistics
data = {
    'Player': ['Player A', 'Player B', 'Player C'],
    'Goals': [10, 15, 7],
    'Matches': [20, 25, 15]
}

# Create a DataFrame from the sample data
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

def calculate_total_goals(df):
    # Calculate total goals using a loop (inefficient method)
    total_goals = 0
    for i in range(len(df)):
        total_goals += df['Goals'][i]  # Fill in the blank with the appropriate DataFrame column reference
    return total_goals

# Call the function to calculate total goals
print("Total Goals (Inefficient):", calculate_total_goals(df))

# Optimized method using built-in functions
def calculate_total_goals_optimized(df):
    # Calculate total goals using built-in function (efficient method)
    total_goals_optimized = _______  # Fill in the blank with the appropriate built-in function
    return total_goals_optimized

# Call the optimized function to calculate total goals
print("Total Goals (Optimized):", calculate_total_goals_optimized(df))
```

### 3. Hints
- For the first blank in the `calculate_total_goals_optimized` function, think about how you can use a built-in function to sum values in a DataFrame column without explicitly iterating through it.
- Remember that the built-in `sum()` function can be used for lists or other iterable objects. Consider how you can apply it to a DataFrame column.
- Review how Pandas handles operations on Series objects, as this will help you optimize memory usage and improve performance.

### 4. Expected Outcome
The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly, demonstrating an understanding of how to utilize built-in functions for efficiency. The expected filled-in code should look like this:

```python
# Optimized method using built-in functions
def calculate_total_goals_optimized(df):
    # Calculate total goals using built-in function (efficient method)
    total_goals_optimized = sum(df['Goals'])  # Using sum() to optimize performance
    return total_goals_optimized
```

The final solution should adhere to best practices, include error handling (if necessary), and be well-commented to explain the reasoning behind each step, as emphasized in the lecture.

### Integration
Ensure that the exercise content is well-structured, with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
