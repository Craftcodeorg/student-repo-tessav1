### Module Title: Algorithm Fundamentals ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**:  
   In the context of Premier League Soccer, imagine you are developing a performance analytics tool for Chelsea F.C. The tool needs to analyze player statistics from multiple matches, specifically focusing on their goal scores. You are tasked with implementing and comparing two sorting algorithms: Bubble Sort and QuickSort, to sort the players based on their scores in descending order. Your goal is to determine which algorithm performs better with a dataset of varying sizes representing player scores.

   **Tasks**:
   - Implement both Bubble Sort and QuickSort algorithms.
   - Generate a dataset of random player scores for testing (e.g., between 0 and 100).
   - Measure and compare the execution time of both algorithms on the same dataset.
   - Document your findings and which algorithm performed better under different conditions.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:  
   Below is the starter code for implementing the sorting algorithms. Fill in the blanks to complete the functionality.

```python
import random
import time

# Function to implement Bubble Sort
def bubble_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(0, n-i-1):
            if arr[j] < arr[j+1]:  # Sort in descending order
                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]
    return arr

# Function to implement QuickSort
def quicksort(arr):
    if len(arr) <= 1:
        return arr
    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose the pivot
    left = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than pivot
    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to pivot
    right = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements less than pivot
    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)

# Generate random player scores
def generate_scores(num_players):
    return [random.randint(0, 100) for _ in range(num_players)]

# Main function to test sorting algorithms
def main():
    num_players = 1000  # Number of players
    scores = generate_scores(num_players)

    # Measure time for Bubble Sort
    start_time = time.time()
    sorted_scores_bubble = bubble_sort(scores.copy())
    bubble_time = time.time() - start_time
    print("Bubble Sort Time:", bubble_time)

    # Measure time for QuickSort
    start_time = time.time()
    sorted_scores_quick = quicksort(scores.copy())
    quick_time = time.time() - start_time
    print("QuickSort Time:", quick_time)

# Run the main function
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

3. **Hints**:  
   - When implementing sorting algorithms, think about how each algorithm processes elements and how that affects performance.
   - Consider edge cases, such as when all scores are the same or when the dataset is already sorted.
   - Use Python's built-in `time` module to measure the execution time of your sorting algorithms accurately.
   - Ensure that you understand the time complexity of both Bubble Sort (O(n^2)) and QuickSort (O(n log n)) and how they apply to your dataset size.

4. **Expected Outcome**:  
   By completing this exercise, you will demonstrate your understanding of sorting algorithms and their performance implications in real-world scenarios, particularly in sports analytics. The final solution should:
   - Correctly implement both sorting algorithms.
   - Accurately measure and compare their execution times.
   - Be well-commented to explain each step and decision made during the implementation.
   - Handle potential errors gracefully, such as empty datasets or invalid inputs.

### Integration ###
- Ensure that this exercise is structured clearly with headings and sections for easy parsing into your learning platform.
- Use markdown for formatting and provide any necessary files or resources as links if applicable.
