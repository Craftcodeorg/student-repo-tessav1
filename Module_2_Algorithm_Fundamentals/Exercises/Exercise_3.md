### Module Title: Algorithm Fundamentals ###

### Exercise Requirements ###

1. **Problem Statement**: 
   You are tasked with optimizing the seating arrangement for a Chelsea F.C. soccer match. The players need to be positioned on a chessboard-like grid (8x8) in such a way that no two players can attack each other, similar to the N-Queens problem in chess. Each player represents a queen, and the goal is to place all 8 players on the board such that no two players share the same row, column, or diagonal. Implement a backtracking algorithm to solve this problem.

2. **Fill-in-the-Blank Starter Code**:
```python
# Starter code for solving the N-Queens problem using backtracking
def is_safe(board, row, col):
    # Check if it's safe to place a player at board[row][col]
    for i in range(____):  # Check the current column
        if board[i][col] == 'Q':  # 'Q' represents a player
            return False
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, -1, -1)):  # Check upper diagonal on left side
        if board[i][j] == 'Q':
            return False
    for i, j in zip(range(row, -1, -1), range(col, len(board))):  # Check upper diagonal on right side
        if board[i][j] == 'Q':
            return False
    return True

def solve_n_queens_util(board, row):
    if row == len(board):  # All players have been placed successfully
        return True
    for col in range(len(board)):
        if is_safe(board, row, col):  # Check if it's safe to place the player
            board[row][col] = 'Q'  # Place player
            if solve_n_queens_util(board, row + 1):  # Recur to place rest of the players
                return True
            board[row][col] = '.'  # Backtrack
    return False

def solve_n_queens():
    n = 8  # Size of the chessboard
    board = [['.' for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]  # Initialize chessboard
    if not solve_n_queens_util(board, 0):  # Start solving from the first row
        print("Solution does not exist")
        return
    print_board(board)

def print_board(board):
    for row in board:
        print(" ".join(row))

# Run the function to see the result
solve_n_queens()
```

3. **Hints**:
   - Remember that each player can attack another if they are in the same row, column, or diagonal. Use loops to check these conditions.
   - The `is_safe` function should return `True` only if placing a player at a specific position does not lead to an attack.
   - Utilize backtracking by placing a player and then trying to place the next one. If it fails, backtrack by removing the player and trying the next column.

4. **Expected Outcome**:
   The student should be able to fill in the blanks correctly and run the program to see a valid arrangement of players on the chessboard where no two players threaten each other. The final solution should include error handling for cases where no solution exists and be well-commented to explain each step of the algorithm. This exercise reinforces understanding of backtracking algorithms and their application in real-world scenarios like optimizing team formations in sports.

### Integration ###
- Ensure the exercise content is well-structured with clear headings and sections for easy parsing and integration into the learning platform. Use markdown for formatting and include any necessary files or resources as links.
