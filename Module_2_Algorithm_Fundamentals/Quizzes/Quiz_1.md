### Quiz Questions ###

1. **What is the primary difference between linear search and binary search?**  
   - A) Linear search is faster than binary search for large datasets.  
   - B) Binary search requires the data to be sorted, while linear search does not.  
   - C) Linear search uses recursion, while binary search does not.  
   - D) Binary search can only be used on numerical data, while linear search can be used on any data type.  
   - **Correct Answer**: B) Binary search requires the data to be sorted, while linear search does not.

2. **Which of the following statements is true about the time complexity of linear and binary search?**  
   - A) Linear search has a time complexity of O(log n), while binary search has O(n).  
   - B) Both linear and binary search have the same time complexity of O(n).  
   - C) Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), while binary search has O(log n).  
   - D) Both searches have constant time complexity O(1).  
   - **Correct Answer**: C) Linear search has a time complexity of O(n), while binary search has O(log n).

3. **In which scenario would you prefer to use binary search over linear search?**  
   - A) When searching for an element in an unsorted array.  
   - B) When searching for an element in a large sorted array.  
   - C) When the dataset is very small.  
   - D) When you want to find all occurrences of an element in the dataset.  
   - **Correct Answer**: B) When searching for an element in a large sorted array.
